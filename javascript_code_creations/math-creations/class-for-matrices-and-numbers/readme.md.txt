The Matrix class provides basic functionality for matrix addition and multiplication.
The CustomNumber class handles arbitrary-precision numbers and includes functionality for adding large numbers, multiplying them using matrix methods, and converting between different forms (arrays, numbers).
There is an incomplete division method in CustomNumber that doesn't yet provide full functionality.

This code seems to be part of a library or tool aimed at dealing with matrices and large numbers (like big integers).
